3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile Methodology:
Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and continuous improvement. It divides projects into small, manageable units called sprints, allowing for frequent reassessments and adjustments based on ongoing feedback. Agile promotes close collaboration between developers, stakeholders, and customers, ensuring that evolving requirements can be accommodated. The main advantages of Agile include faster delivery, adaptability to changes, and continuous customer involvement, which leads to higher satisfaction. However, it also comes with challenges, such as the need for active customer participation, difficulty in predicting project timelines, and potential scope creep due to frequent changes.
Waterfall Methodology:
Waterfall follows a structured, sequential approach where each phaseâ€”requirements, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenanceâ€”is completed before moving to the next. It works best for well-defined projects with stable requirements, offering clear documentation and predictable timelines. Since all planning is done upfront, the process is straightforward and easy to manage. However, Waterfall lacks flexibility, making it difficult to accommodate changes once the project has started. Testing occurs late in the development cycle, which can lead to costly fixes if issues arise. Additionally, customer involvement is minimal after the initial planning phase, which can result in a final product that may not fully meet evolving business needs.
4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is more beneficial for:
Projects that are dynamic, have evolving requirements, or require frequent updates. It works best for software development, startups, and industries where customer feedback is crucial. Agile is ideal for products that need continuous improvement, such as mobile apps, SaaS platforms, and e-commerce websites.
ðŸ”¹ Example: Developing a social media app where features need to be tested and adjusted based on user feedback. Agile allows for quick iterations, ensuring that the app evolves according to user needs.
Waterfall is more beneficial for:
Projects with well-defined requirements, strict deadlines, or regulatory constraints. It is ideal for industries like construction, manufacturing, or government projects, where changes can be costly and time-consuming. Waterfall ensures a structured approach with detailed documentation.
ðŸ”¹ Example: Building a bridge or developing software for a banking system with strict compliance regulations. Since requirements are clear from the beginning, Waterfall ensures a predictable and controlled process.
5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Methods for Ensuring Quality Assurance in Software Projects  
1. Requirement Analysis & Documentationâ€“ Clearly define project requirements to avoid misunderstandings and ensure all stakeholders are aligned from the start.
